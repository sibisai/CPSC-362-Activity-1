# Welcome to React Router Portion!

A modern, production-ready template for building full-stack React applications using React Router.

[![Open in StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/github/remix-run/react-router-templates/tree/main/default)

## Features

- üöÄ Server-side rendering
- ‚ö°Ô∏è Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
- üì¶ Asset bundling and optimization
- üîÑ Data loading and mutations
- üîí TypeScript by default
- üéâ TailwindCSS for styling
- üìñ [React Router docs](https://reactrouter.com/)

## Getting Started

Change Directories to the my-react-router-app:

```bash
cd my-react-router-app
```

### Installation

Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

### Development

Start the development server with HMR:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Building for Production

Create a production build:

```bash
npm run build
```

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment

To build and run using Docker:

```bash
docker build -t my-app .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-app
```

The containerized application can be deployed to any platform that supports Docker, including:

- AWS ECS
- Google Cloud Run
- Azure Container Apps
- Digital Ocean App Platform
- Fly.io
- Railway

### DIY Deployment

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `npm run build`

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package-lock.json (or pnpm-lock.yaml, or bun.lockb)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ build/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ client/    # Static assets
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ server/    # Server-side code
```

## Styling

This template comes with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) already configured for a simple default starting experience. You can use whatever CSS framework you prefer.

Built with ‚ù§Ô∏è using React Router.

# Project Server Setup and Docker Configuration

This project uses a multi-container Docker setup for the backend (server) and frontend.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed and running.
- Node.js and npm (for local development).

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the **server/** directory with the following content:

```dotenv
MONGO_URI="mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.yfrzaxs.mongodb.net/yourDatabaseName?retryWrites=true&w=majority"
PORT=3001
```

Make sure to update the MONGO_URI with your actual credentials and desired database name.

### Docker Configuration

1. **Dockerfile for the Backend (Server)**

The Dockerfile in the server folder should look like this:

```dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine
WORKDIR /app

# Copy dependency files and install dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Expose the port your application listens on
EXPOSE 3001

# Start the application
CMD ["node", "index.js"]
```

2. **Docker Compose File**

The docker-compose.yml in your project root should be configured as follows:

```yaml
services:
  server:
    build:
      context: ./server
    ports:
      - "3001:3001"
    env_file:
      - ./server/.env
  frontend:
    build:
      context: ./my-react-router-app
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
```

Notes:

- The `env_file` property tells Docker Compose to load environment variables from the specified file (e.g., your MongoDB URI in .env).
- Ensure your .env file is in the proper directory (e.g., in server/) and is included in your .gitignore so it isn't pushed to GitHub.

### Running the Application

#### Using Docker Compose

1. **Build and Start Containers:**
   Navigate to the project root and run:

   ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

2. **Access the Endpoints:**
   - The backend API will be available at http://localhost:3001
   - The React frontend will be available at http://localhost:3000

#### Local Development

If you prefer to run locally without Docker, from the server/ folder run:

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm start
```

### Testing the API Endpoints

Use Postman or any similar API tool to test the following endpoints:

- **User Signup:**

  ```
  POST http://localhost:3001/auth/signup
  Body (JSON):
  {
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "password": "yourpassword"
  }
  ```

- **User Login:**

  ```
  POST http://localhost:3001/auth/login
  Body (JSON):
  {
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "password": "yourpassword"
  }
  ```

- **Create Property:**

  ```
  POST http://localhost:3001/properties
  Body (JSON):
  {
    "title": "Cozy Cottage",
    "description": "A beautiful cottage with a stunning view."
  }
  ```

- **Get All Properties:**

  ```
  GET http://localhost:3001/properties
  ```

- **Get a Specific Property:**

  ```
  GET http://localhost:3001/properties/{{propertyId}}
  ```

- **Update Property:**

  ```
  PUT http://localhost:3001/properties/{{propertyId}}
  Body (JSON):
  {
    "title": "Renovated Cozy Cottage",
    "description": "A renovated cottage with modern amenities."
  }
  ```

- **Delete Property:**
  ```
  DELETE http://localhost:3001/properties/{{propertyId}}
  ```

Replace `{{propertyId}}` with the actual property ID received from the create endpoint.

---

### Booking Endpoints

#### Create a Booking

```
POST http://localhost:3001/bookings
Body (JSON):
{
  "propertyId": "property_id_here",
  "userId": "user_id_here",
  "startDate": "2025-05-01",
  "endDate": "2025-05-05"
}
```

#### Get All Bookings

```
GET http://localhost:3001/bookings
```

#### Get Bookings for a Property

```
GET http://localhost:3001/properties/:id/bookings
```

Replace `:id` with the actual `propertyId`.
